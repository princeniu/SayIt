# Privacy Policy for SayIt

**Last Updated: February 5, 2026**

SayIt is designed with a "Privacy First" philosophy. We believe your voice and your data belong to you.

### 1. No Data Collection
SayIt **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data, voice recordings, or transcriptions to any external servers or third parties. 

### 2. On-Device Processing
- **Voice Transcription**: All voice-to-text processing is performed locally on your Mac using OpenAI's Whisper model (via `whisper.cpp`) or Apple's on-device Speech framework.
- **Audio Data**: Your audio is captured and processed in memory. It is never saved to disk and is discarded immediately after transcription is complete.

### 3. Third-Party Services
SayIt does not use any third-party analytics or tracking SDKs. 
- **Model Downloads**: If you choose to download a Whisper model, the app connects directly to Hugging Face or our official repository to fetch the model file. No identifying information is sent during this process.
- **Updates (Non-App Store Version)**: The version of SayIt distributed via our website uses Sparkle to check for updates. This process checks for a new version number but does not collect personal information.

### 4. Permissions
SayIt requests the following permissions for the sole purpose of functioning:
- **Microphone**: To capture your voice for transcription.
- **Speech Recognition**: To use Apple's built-in transcription engine.

### 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our GitHub repository.
